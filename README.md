# Manservant

Browse man pages in style with your personal manservant.

Fed up with browsing manual pages in a console using `less` or Googling for
the man page only to realize that your local install differs from the man page
you found? Me too, so last night I hacked together manservant to serve up
local man pages over HTTP with some pretty UI sprinkled over it.

Here's [tmux][]'s man page served to you by manservant:

This version of manservant includes a static manservant page 
generator/viewer system, developed by Anand Gupta. Essentially, this allows you
to invoke manservant from the commandline and have a browser with a neat
manserver page come up, without keeping a server running in the background. 

## Requirements

- [Ruby][].
- [Bundler][] Ruby gem.

[ruby]: http://www.ruby-lang.org/
[bundler]: http://gembundler.com/

## Installation

Manserver comes in two forms, one a static html-man page prettifier,
and the other a full-fledged a web application.

### Static version

Manserver can be invoked statically by running the manserver.sh script 
in the bin folder: 
`./manserver.sh [programname]`

We still need to make the PATH-coupled installation process easier, but for now
some shell scripting will be required to properly integrate this with your system.

### Web app version 
Manservant is a simple [Sinatra][] application, and is run just like any other
Rack application.

#### Pow

The simplest way to run manservant is through [Pow][]. Ensure you have Pow
installed and working, and run the following to install manservant:

    git clone https://github.com/jimeh/manservant.git ~/.pow/man
    cd ~/.pow/man
    bundle install

Then visit [http://man.dev/](http://man.dev/) in your browser.

[pow]: http://pow.cx/

#### Other

There's many ways to run a Rack application, and I'm not gonna cover that
here. But if you merely want to get manservant up and running to have a look,
just clone the repo and run `rackup` inside the project directory:

    git clone https://github.com/jimeh/manservant.git ~/Projects/manservant
    cd ~/Projects/manservant
    rackup

Then visit [http://localhost:9292/](http://localhost:9292/) in your browser.

## Credits

- Man page to HTML conversion is done by [man2html][], which is bundled into
  manservant.
- The HTML UI style is shamelessly ripped from the [ronn][] gem's HTML output
  format.

## Todo
